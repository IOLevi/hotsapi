# Hotslogs rankings scraper

Objective is to scrape winrates from hotslogs to convert it into a workable API

Stretch
-- host the api on my web1 server
-- connect it with a webapp or a mobile app so I can play with the data
-- maybe connect with trello to ping my phone with today's top 2/3 of each hero class
-- output a suggested pick/bans list based on the current winrates that the API scrapes
